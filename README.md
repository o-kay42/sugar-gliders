# 2D-Template

The following is a template you must copy when creating a 2D project in the video game design class. If working with team members, you must share the new repository with them so they can work on the copy of the repository and not the original.

## Instructions

1. Copy the repository template by clicking the "Use This Template" button at the top-right corner of this page
2. Share this repository with anyone working on the project with you
3. Clone the new repository to your computer (repeat this step for each computer you're using)
4. Open Unity Hub on your computer and install Unity 2022.1.22f1
5. Click the "Open" button at the top-right of Unity Hub and select the "2D-Template" folder inside the cloned repository
6. Do whatever you'd like with the project!
7. Stage your changes to the repository
8. Commit your changes to the repository
9. If working with others who have recently pushed changes, pull their changes to your computer
10. Push your changes to the repository

Repeat steps 6-10 as you continue to work on the project.
